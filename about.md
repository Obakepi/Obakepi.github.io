## Daniel About




Progress on my GUI:

I want to create a graphical interface for my calorie counting tool.
It will ask you for a food name and measurement and then output its caloric value.
I think I could add on to this tool a lot and it could florish into something much more useful, but that is my plan for the base of it.

I have not tried anything as of right after spring break.
